# Elist-Electronics-Analysis

## Project Background
Elist, founded in 2018, is a global e-commerce company specializing in popular electronics. It operates through both its website and mobile app, leveraging marketing channels such as email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate partnerships to reach customers. In recent years, top-selling products have included devices from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad.
This data analysis was conducted to generate insights for key departments—including finance, sales, product, and marketing. The goal was to help stakeholders better understand Elist’s performance and support improvements in day-to-day operations, ultimately enhancing the company’s ability to deliver high-quality products to customers worldwide.

## Key Stakeholder Questions

1. What were the overall sales trends from 2019 to 2022?
2. What were the company’s monthly and yearly growth rates?
3. How is the new loyalty program performing? Should we keep using it? 
4. What were the company’s refund rate and average order value?

## Project Goals 

# Executive Summary

# Deep-Dive Insights

## Historical Trends

## Seasonal Trends
• Top Performing Months: December, September, and January consistently generate the highest revenue and order volume. These peaks likely reflect increased consumer spending during the holiday season and back-to-school periods

• Lowest Performing Months: February, October, and June tend to have the lowest revenue and order counts, possibly due to a post-holiday dip and reduced spending following the back-to-school season

• Holiday Surge Effect: November shows a strong seasonal lift, with an average revenue increase of 18% and an average order increase of 24% compared to the previous month. December follows with an average monthly revenue increase of 23% and a 21% rise in orders, likely driven by holiday gift purchases and year-end promotions

## Product Trends
• Top Grossing Products: The 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor, Apple AirPods, and MacBook Air are the highest revenue-generating products, accounting for 35%, 27.5%, and 22.4% of total sales, respectively

• Products with Highest Average Order Value (AOV):The MacBook Air ($1,588), ThinkPad ($1,100), and Apple iPhone ($741) have the highest AOVs, indicating strong revenue potential per transaction

• Greatest Order Volume: Apple AirPods lead with 48,000 orders, followed by the 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor (23,000 orders) and Samsung Charging Cable Pack (21,000 orders), highlighting consistent customer demand

• Lowest Performing Product: The Bose SoundSport significantly underperformed, generating less than 0.1% of total revenue, with just $3,000 in sales and 27 orders overall

Opportunity for Growth

• Despite its high AOV and strong brand association, the Apple iPhone contributes just 0.8% of total revenue

• Given the success of other Apple products, increasing targeted marketing for the iPhone—through email campaigns, homepage features, or bundles—could significantly boost revenue and better leverage customer interest in the Apple ecosystem

## Geographical Trends
• Top-Grossing Country: The United States is the leading market, generating 47.3% of total sales revenue—over six times that of the United Kingdom, which ranks second

• Top 5 Countries by Revenue: The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Denmark are the top five revenue-generating countries, together accounting for 66.1% of total sales

• Top 5 Countries by Order Volume: The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Denmark make up the top five countries by number of orders, contributing a combined 66.9% of total order volume

• High AOV Opportunity in Japan: Among the top 5 countries by revenue, Japan has the highest average order value (AOV) at $393, but the lowest order volume

  • Recommendation: Increase targeted marketing and promotional efforts in Japan to boost order count and unlock additional revenue potential

# Loyalty Program 
• Non-loyalty members have outperformed loyalty members in total revenue and average order value (AOV) over the full period as non-loyalty members generated $17M in revenue with an AOV of $263, while loyalty members generated $11M in revenue with an AOV of $225

• Non-loyalty members had a higher average monthly revenue of $357K, compared to $229K for loyalty members

Yearly Trends

• In 2019 and 2020, non-loyalty members led in total sales, AOV, and order volume

• In 2021, a trend reversal occurred: loyalty members surpassed non-loyalty members in both sales and order count

• In 2022, loyalty members also overtook non-loyalty members in AOV, continuing the positive trend

Recent Monthly Reversal (Late 2022)

• In the final months of 2022, non-loyalty members again outperformed loyalty members in both revenue and AOV

# Refund Rates
Refund Trends Across All Products

• The overall refund rate across all products was 5% with a total of 1.4M in refund amounts 

• Refund rates peaked in 2020 at 9.2%, followed by a sharp decline in 2021, and no recorded refunds in 2022

  • Notably, no refunds were recorded from August 2021 onward, indicating a potential data gap
 
• Products with Highest Refund Rates: ThinkPad: 11.7%, MacBook Air: 11.4%, Apple iPhone: 7.6%, 27-in 4K Gaming Monitor: 6.2%

• Products with Highest Total Refund Amounts: MacBook Air: $719K, 27-in 4K Gaming Monitor: $607K, Apple AirPods: $421K, ThinkPad: $376K
